**Gradient Boosted Tree Classifer**

**Definition**
It is a machine learning technique used for regression analysis and for statistical classification problems, which produces a predictive model in the form of a set of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.
GBT builds trees one at a time, where each new tree helps correct the mistakes made by a previously trained tree.
